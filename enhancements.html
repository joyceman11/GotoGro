<h2>Types of enhancements used on this site</h2>
<h3>Responsive Design: </h3>
<p>Having a responsive layout allows different users to view your webpage on different devices with the layout of the page adjusted to suit that device
In order to achieve this I have included 'viewport' in the html documents in the head section to indicate that this page will be responsive to the device it is being viewed on. 
	Not only does it only adjust text displayed on the screen it also adjusts images as well.</p>
<h5>These adjustments are suitable for different media displays listed below:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>- Medium Displays: Tablets, iPads<li>
	<li>- Small Displays: Phones<li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you weren't on another device, you are able to see this through the Firefox or Chrome browser, by selecting 'Developer Tools' and choosing the device you want to view it from.</p> 

<h3>Additional CSS Selectors and Properties:</h3>
  <h5>Image Overlay:</h5>
 <ul>
  <li>- Through the use of additional selectors and properties I am able to create a new way of viewing images. 
In the home page, you are able to see the image roll over on the s20 image, where when the mouse hovers over it,
a light blue screen will go ontop of it and display the price for the device in accordance to its storage amount. You are able to see this on the <a href="index.html">home page.</a></li>
</ul>

 <h5>Image Flip:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>- Furthermore, I have also added a pseudo-element where if the mouse hovers over an image it will flip an image. You are able to see this on the<a href="products.html"> products page.</a></li>
 </ul>

	<h5>Side by Side:</h5>
	<ul>
    <li>- I also was able to have all three of the products laid side by side, I did this because it is easier for the user to view all products without
having to scroll. You are able to see this on the <a href="products.html">products page</a></li>
</ul>
